Established 15 years ago, Aihua has grown to have over 50 foreign teachers and 100 Chinese staff. It is the best place to make your first start in China with strong support and training. I hope to welcome you to our community soon.\r\n\r\nMost of our classes have a maximum of 8 students, and teachers follow a set curriculum supplemented by an interactive whiteboard and extensive multimedia material. Foreign teachers work together with local co-teachers, who act as a bridge between the school and the parents.\r\n\r\nForeign teachers are hired for 90 teaching periods (45-50 mins) per month. Our teachers normally teach around 20 periods per week. There are no office hours, but teachers must prepare lessons well, and attend weekly training and meetings.\r\n\r\nWages and benefits\r\n\r\nCompetitive - plus bonuses \r\nHealth insurance \r\nWorking visa \r\nFlights covered\r\n\r\nHere are many of the other reasons why teachers choose us over other schools;\r\n\r\nWe always deal fairly with teachers. We recognize that our reputation for fair dealing is our most important resource. Above all, we value the honour and the good name of our school. Feel free to read blogs by our teachers on our website and social media here;\r\n\r\nwww.facebook.com/aihuaenglishacademy \u2028 \r\nen.aihua-english.com\r\n\r\nWe have western management. This sets us apart from many other schools in China. This creates a more comfortable and transparent working environment for our foreign teachers.\r\n\r\nWe have a friendly, fun and professional working environment by providing complete support to our foreign teachers in all aspects of life and teaching.\r\n\r\nWe run a set curriculum, and our terms are fixed. A teacher receives a timetable at the beginning of the term, and this remains constant throughout the term. The teacher will have the teachers book, and the students will have the students book. A clear course plan detailing the speed of teaching will be presented to the teacher.\r\n\r\nExtensive multimedia resources related to each unit in each program are available to the teacher.\r\n\r\nOur classes are small, with a maximum of eight students. Experienced and helpful Chinese teachers work together and support our foreign teachers in these smaller classes where you can really get to know your students.\r\n\r\nWe have 3 professional development tracks for teachers wishing to take on higher roles at our school: training, administration and management.\r\n\r\nFree professional Mandarin lessons. We have an in-house professional Chinese teacher who has a degree in teaching Chinese as a second language. She will help you learn the local lingo fast.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in working at Aihua, please write to the Recruitment Manager Robert Warman, at robert@aihua-english.com or robert-warman@outlook.com","kicker":"Well established school - great working environment","pictureUrl":"yuxix-321312.jpg","dateCreated":{"$date":"2018-05-30T21:53:47.674Z"},"__v":0}
